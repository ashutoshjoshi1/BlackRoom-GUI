# Split GUI

This package was generated by splitting your original `gui.py` into separate modules for each tab:
- `tabs/live_view_tab.py`
- `tabs/measurements_tab.py`
- `tabs/analysis_tab.py`
- `tabs/setup_tab.py`

`app.py` is your original code with only the `_build_*_tab` methods replaced to delegate
UI construction to the corresponding module functions.

## How to run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes

- All event handlers and business logic remain in `app.py`. Only the UI construction for each tab moved out.
- You can further refactor by moving handlers specific to a tab into that tab module and importing them back into `app.py`.
